            <h2>WELCOME!</h2>
            <p>We are happy to offer both in-person and virtual services. CAPS is committed to creating an environment
                based on our values of multicultural, multi-disciplinary and multi-theoretical practices that allow our
                diverse student body to access care, receive high quality services and take positive pathways to mental
                health.
                Our Front Desk (Michigan Union 4th Floor) is open and ready to help support you -- staff members are
                available throughout the day to assist you with your needs to answer questions, and get you to the right
                place. We can be reached by phone at: (734) 764-8312.
                CAPS has a limited number of private spaces available for students to connect with their counselor via
                telecounseling. Please contact the front desk for more information on those private spaces.
                Please Note: During high-demand periods, CAPS will be unable to accommodate class-related interviews
                and/or projects. Many students are able to find the information they need within our website and our
                annual reports.
                CAPS office is unable to participate in scavenger hunts for students due to maintaining the
                confidentiality of our clients. However, you are welcome to direct students to the wellness zone, which
                has a separate entrance adjacent to CAPS. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the
                CAPS office. </p>
